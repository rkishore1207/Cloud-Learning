# AZURE CLOUD SERVICES

## Describe Cloud Computing
### Shared Responsibility Model
* If we have our own **DataCenters**, then we need to responsible for all the factors such as Natural Disasters, Network, Operating System's Update, Security, Data breach, etc..
* This is our head weight only, isn't it?
* For me, i need to design **WebApplication**, and provide **good service** to my customers. These things are all **extra burden**.
* So to handOver this problems to great organizations such as `Microsoft`, Google, Amazon as a **Cloud service**, they can take over all the problems and provide good service for us.
* Here we are `sharing our Responsibility` to them.
* But eventhough we were share our responsible, still we need to handle some of the **security informations** such as our User's credential, Authentication, Application security... these thing are took care by ourself.
* So we are `mixed sharing the Responsibilities`.
